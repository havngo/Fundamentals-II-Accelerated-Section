Fundamentals II Introduction to Class-based Program Design 

“Think first, experiment later.”

The course studies the class-based program design and the design of abstractions that support the design of reusable software and libraries. 
It covers the principles of object oriented program design, the basic rules of program evaluation, and examines the relationship between 
algorithms and data structures, as well as basic techniques for analyzing algorithm complexity.
